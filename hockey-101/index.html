        <p>Not too far ago, we had a corporate party and so my boss asked me about my hobbies. And I responded that I really like ice skating. Well, what I really mean that I like freestyle ice skating, but to him this part I suppose wasn't as clear as it should be. And so, somehow we moved on to the hockey playing. Well, I play it on rare occasions, because of that I had some stories to tell him about but as soon I started doing it I discover my complete lack of the hockey vocabulary. Well, that is the main reason of this post, here I'm going to keep track of what I had done to fix my vocabulary gap.</p>

It's just a motivational video before start studying hockey vocabulary, but still it has some basics like stick and puck.</p>

<p>Here are some questions that I came up with by watching the videos above:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the main object of the game?</li>
<li>What is a puck?</li>
<li>What is the size difference between an NHL hockey rink and an international hockey rink?</li>
<li>How does the game of hockey start?</li>
<li>How many players are on a hockey team?</li>
<li>How many periods are in a hockey game?</li>
<li>What is the actual time duration of a hockey game?</li>
<li>How do hockey substitutions work?</li>
<li>What is a penalty shot in hockey?</li>
<li>Could you explain the icing rule in hockey?</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.purehockey.com/hockey-culture-traditions/whats-the-difference-between-a-hockey-referee-and-a-linesman/">What's the difference between a hockey referee and a linesman?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After that I tried to answer those questions using new vocabulary:
<code>free substitution</code> <code>powerplay</code> <code>net</code> <code>penalty kill</code> <code>man advantage</code> <code>puck</code> <code>penalty box</code> <code>penalty shot</code> <code>offside</code> <code>icing</code> <code>tie</code> <code>overtime</code> <code>shootout</code> <code>stick</code> <code>period</code> <code>goaltender</code> <code>linesman</code> <code>neutral zone</code> <code>face-off</code> <code>cherry-picking</code></p>
<h2 id="hockey-musical-movie">Hockey Musical Movie</h2>
<p>Well, after grasping major hockey terms and rules, it's time to see ways to use them. And, accidentally, I came accross this musical film:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QTdv4lAzvHE" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>
</p>
<p>If this had happened the other day, I would probably just skip it. But right before that day I had a chat about musical films with a friend of mine. What a coincidence, right? Besides that I don't really a fan of that kinda movies. But I decided to give it a try and at the end I found out that watching such genre of movies is worth it, at least I consider it beneficial for myself.</p>
<p>That said, here are some sentences from the movie that make usage of the hockey vocabulary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stoped the slapshot with his tonsils.</li>
<li>Is that alright(Protective cup)? Unless you are a dickface.</li>
<li>When do you think passing a puck?</li>
</ul>
<p>And here's <a href="https://www.federgreenentertainment.com/Score-Press_Kit.pdf">press kit</a> for the movie maybe it will be interested to you as well.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
