<meta property="og:description" content="Hey there and Marry Christmas to you all! Today and probably the day after today, I&#39;m going to start working on my christmas vocabulary. Actually, today is day when I, for the first time in my life, discovered such a word like tinsel. And I was a bit shocked that I had never heard of it before.
Anyway, thanks James for this one:   Yesterday, I got video with Adam Roa on my youtube recomended list and after that I was completely hooked by this stuff called spoken word." />

        <p>Hey there and Marry Christmas to you all! Today and probably the day after today, I'm going to start working on my christmas vocabulary. Actually, today is day when I, for the first time in my life, discovered such a word like <code>tinsel</code>. And I was a bit shocked that I had never heard of it before.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks James for this one:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H7ORsq60NjM" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>
</p>
<p>Yesterday, I got video with Adam Roa on my youtube recomended list and after that I was completely hooked by this stuff called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_word">spoken word</a>.
So, now I try to imitate a spoken word poem &lsquo;Remember to laugh&rsquo; by Adam Roa.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nn-YHUndu_Y" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

I assume that it will have a nice reflection on my pronunciation, and if not, well, I will enjoy the process anyway.</p>
<p>Goodnight everyone and Marry Christmas!</p>
