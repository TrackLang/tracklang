      <description>Not too far ago, we had a corporate party and so my boss asked me about my hobbies. And I responded that I really like ice skating. Well, what I really mean that I like freestyle ice skating, but to him this part I suppose wasn&#39;t as clear as it should be. And so, somehow we moved on to the hockey playing. Well, I play it on rare occasions, because of that I had some stories to tell him about but as soon I started doing it I discover my complete lack of the hockey vocabulary.</description>
