Not too far ago, we had a corporate party and so my boss asked me about my hobbies. And I responded that I really like ice skating. Well, what I really mean that I like freestyle ice skating, but to him this part I suppose wasn't as clear as it should be. And so, somehow we moved on to the hockey playing. Well, I play it on rare occasions, because of that I had some stories to tell him about but as soon I started doing it I discover my complete lack of the hockey vocabulary. Well, that is the main reason of this post, here I'm going to keep track of what I had done to fix my vocabulary gap.

## Truly motivated kid and his unreal hockey skills

It's just a motivational video before start studying hockey vocabulary, but still it has some basics like stick and puck.

Here are some questions that I came up with by watching the videos above:
- What is the main object of the game?
- What is a puck?
- What is the size difference between an NHL hockey rink and an international hockey rink?
- How does the game of hockey start?
- How many players are on a hockey team?
- How many periods are in a hockey game?
- What is the actual time duration of a hockey game?
- How do hockey substitutions work?
- What is a penalty shot in hockey?
- Could you explain the icing rule in hockey?
- [What's the difference between a hockey referee and a linesman?](https://blog.purehockey.com/hockey-culture-traditions/whats-the-difference-between-a-hockey-referee-and-a-linesman/)

After that I tried to answer those questions using new vocabulary:
`free substitution` `powerplay` `net` `penalty kill` `man advantage` `puck` `penalty box` `penalty shot` `offside` `icing` `tie` `overtime` `shootout` `stick` `period` `goaltender` `linesman` `neutral zone` `face-off` `cherry-picking`

## Hockey Musical Movie
Well, after grasping major hockey terms and rules, it's time to see ways to use them. And, accidentally, I came accross this musical film:

If this had happened the other day, I would probably just skip it. But right before that day I had a chat about musical films with a friend of mine. What a coincidence, right? Besides that I don't really a fan of that kinda movies. But I decided to give it a try and at the end I found out that watching such genre of movies is worth it, at least I consider it beneficial for myself.

That said, here are some sentences from the movie that make usage of the hockey vocabulary:
* Stoped the slapshot with his tonsils.
* Is that alright(Protective cup)? Unless you are a dickface. 
* When do you think passing a puck?

And here's [press kit](https://www.federgreenentertainment.com/Score-Press_Kit.pdf) for the movie maybe it will be interested to you as well.

That's it.
