Not too far ago, we had a corporate party and so my boss asked me about my hobbies. And I responded that I really like ice skating. Well, what I really mean that I like freestyle ice skating, but to him this part I suppose wasn't as clear as it should be. And so, somehow we moved on to the hockey playing. Well, I play it on rare occasions, because of that I had some stories to tell him about but as soon I started doing it I discover my complete lack of the hockey vocabulary. Well, that is the main reason of this post, here I'm going to keep track of what I had done to fix my vocabulary gap.

It's just a motivational video before start studying hockey vocabulary, but still it has some basics like stick and puck.

Here are some questions that I came up with by watching the videos above:
- What is the main object of the game?
- What is a puck?
- What is the size difference between an NHL hockey rink and an international hockey rink?
- How does the game of hockey start?
- How many players are on a hockey team?
- How many periods are in a hockey game?
- What is the actual time duration of a hockey game?
- How do hockey substitutions work?
- What is a penalty shot in hockey?
- Could you explain the icing rule in hockey?
- [What's the difference between a hockey referee and a linesman?](https://blog.purehockey.com/hockey-culture-traditions/whats-the-difference-between-a-hockey-referee-and-a-linesman/)

After that I tried to answer those questions using new vocabulary:
`free substitution` `powerplay` `net` `penalty kill` `man advantage` `puck` `penalty box` `penalty shot` `offside` `icing` `tie` `overtime` `shootout` `stick` `period` `goaltender` `linesman` `neutral zone` `face-off` `cherry-picking`

That's it for now.
